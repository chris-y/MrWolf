Introduction
------------

Fade ("Facts for AmigaDE") is a time server/client implementation for AmigaDE.  It is very much
work-in-progress and currently only consists of a command line client interface.  GUI and server
features will be available later.

A concept document is available as app/fade/doc/concept.txt

Installation
------------

The following files are REQUIRED and must be copied to the AmigaDE root:
lib/unsat/joinstr.00
app/fade/nettime.00

Additionally, at least one of the following must be copied:
app/fade/client/daytime.00
app/fade/client/timetcp.00
app/fade/client/timeudp.00
app/fade/client/sntp.00

Usage
-----

app/fade/nettime <server> <protocol>

Where:
<server> is the server name, eg. ntp2a.mcc.ac.uk
<protocol> is the protocol, eg. sntp
           (same as the file names in app/fade/client/ but without the extension)
